## Fibonacci Sequence

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.

By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...
```

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Pseudocode

```plaintext
FUNCTION generate_and_sum_even_fibonacci(limit):
    // Initialize variables
    SET a = 0
    SET b = 1
    SET sum_of_evens = 0
    SET sequence_array = []

    // Loop while the current term is within the limit
    WHILE a <= limit:
        // Add the current term to our sequence list
        ADD a TO sequence_array

        // Check if the current term is even
        IF a % 2 == 0 THEN
            sum_of_evens = sum_of_evens + a
        END IF

        // Calculate the next term
        SET next_term = a + b
        // Update a and b for the next loop
        SET a = b
        SET b = next_term
    END WHILE

    // Return the results
    RETURN sequence_array AND sum_of
